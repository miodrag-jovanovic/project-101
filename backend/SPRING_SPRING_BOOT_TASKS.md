# Tasks for Spring and Spring Boot presentation

The application consists of a Company part, and an Employee part. The company part is already implemented and working.

Your task will be to implement the Employee part. Here we will focus on the WEB layer

### WEB layer

* Start with the EmployeeResource. This is where we will create the REST endpoints that we can call

* Create the endpoints and verify that you can call them from POSTMAN. Don't worry about what they do or return yet.
Just hardcode a value they always return. First step is creating endpoints we can call. 

* Focus on one at the time.

* As you create the endpoints, the tests in no.acntech.project101.web.employee.resources.EmployeeResourceTest should go green if done correctly (should... )

* If you don't have time to finish all the REST endpoints thats ok.
